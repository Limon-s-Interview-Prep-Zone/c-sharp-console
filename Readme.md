## Overview

This repository is designed for those looking to strengthen their C# skills, particularly for interview preparation. It provides hands-on examples for concepts such as data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more. Each application focuses on different problem-solving techniques and is a great way to enhance your understanding of the C# language and .NET fundamentals.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, youâ€™ll need to clone it to your local machine and have a compatible version of .NET installed. Each console application is self-contained, so you can work with each one individually to explore different concepts.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or higher recommended)
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Limon-s-Interview-Prep-Zone/c-sharp-console.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the repository**:
    ```bash
    cd c-sharp-console
    ```
3. **Build the solution**: Each application can be built individually using the .NET CLI. Navigate to the desired project folder and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```
### Usage
Once built, you can run any console application by navigating to its folder and using the following command:
```bash
dotnet run
```
