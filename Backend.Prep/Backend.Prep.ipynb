    "## Attribute:\n",
    "In ASP.NET Core, attributes are special classes that provide metadata about the code they decorate.\n",
    "1. `Routing Attribute:` Used to configure `routing` for controllers and actions.\n",
    "   - `[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]`: Defines the route template.\n",
    "   - `[HttpGet(\"{id}\")], [HttpPost], [HttpPut], [HttpDelete]`: Specify HTTP methods for the action.\n",
    "2. `Validation Attribute:` Used for model validation in `MVC or API controllers`.\n",
    "   - `[Required]`: Ensures a value is provided.\n",
    "   - `[Range(18,99)]`: Enforces a numeric range.\n",
    "   - `[StringLength]`: Sets string length constraints.\n",
    "3. `Filter Attributes`: Used to add custom logic at various stages of the request pipeline.\n",
    "   - `[Authorize(Roles=\"\")]`: Enforces authorization.\n",
    "   - `[AllowAnonymous]`: Allows anonymous access to endpoints.\n",
    "   - `[CustomActionFilter]`: Apply custom action filters.\n",
    "4. `Binding Attributes`: Used to control model binding in controllers.\n",
    "   - `[FromQuery]` - Gets values from the `query string`.\n",
    "   - `[FromRoute]` - Gets values from `route data`.\n",
    "   - `[FromForm]` - Gets values from posted `form fields`.\n",
    "   - `[FromBody]` - Gets values from the `request body`.\n",
    "   - `[FromHeader]` - Gets values from `HTTP headers`.\n",
    "   - [FromServices] - allow injecting dependencies directly into controller actions.\n",
    "        ```c#\n",
    "        [HttpGet]\n",
    "        public IActionResult GetServiceData([FromServices] IMyService service)\n",

    "        }\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "5. `Exception Handling Attributes:`\n",
    "   - `[ApiController]`: Enhances API behavior, such as automatic validation response and binding improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Binding\n",
    "Model binding is the process by which ASP.NET Core `extracts data` from an HTTP request (e.g., route data, query strings, headers, or request bodies) and maps it to action method parameters or complex types.\n",
    "- `[FromQuery]` - Gets values from the `query string`.\n",
    "- `[FromRoute]` - Gets values from `route data`.\n",
    "- `[FromForm]` - Gets values from posted `form fields`.\n",
    "- `[FromBody]` - Gets values from the `request body`.\n",
    "- `[FromHeader]` - Gets values from `HTTP headers`.\n",
    "- [FromServices] - allow injecting dependencies directly into controller actions.\n",

    "## Filter:\n",
    "Filters are used to execute custom logic before or after an action method in ASP.NET Core applications. They are useful for cross-cutting concerns like `logging, authentication, caching, or input validation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Filters:**\n",
    "1. **Authorization Filters:** Run before the action to ensure the user is authorized.\n",
    "2. **Resource Filters:** Run before the `model binding`, often used to `cache or set up` resources.\n",
    "   - Cache\n",
    "3. **Action Filters:** Run before and after the action method execution.\n",
    "4. **Exception Filters:** Handle exceptions thrown by action methods or other filters.\n",
    "5. **Result Filters:** Run after an action returns a result but before the result is sent to the client.\n",
    "   - APIs where metadata (e.g., pagination info) is added to the response.\n",
    "   - Adding custom `HTTP headers` to all responses.\n",
    "   - Standardizing `all responses` to follow a specific format\n",
    "   - Logging the final response before it is sent to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filter Example**\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "public class CustomActionFilter : IActionFilter\n",

    "## Middleware:\n",
    "Middleware is a pipeline component that `processes requests and responses`. Each request passes through a series of middleware before reaching the final handler (controller or endpoint).\n",
    "   1. Middleware can inspect, modify, or short-circuit requests.\n",
    "   2. Each middleware calls the next middleware or stops the pipeline.\n",

    "## DI\n",
    "Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to achieve `Inversion of Control (IoC)`. It allows a class to `receive its dependencies from an external source` rather `than creating them internally`. This approach promotes loose coupling between components, enhances `code modularity`, and `improves testability`.\n",
    "### Singleton: One instance for the entire application lifecycle\n",
    "A singleton service is created once and reused for the entire lifetime of the application (until the app shuts down). All classes that request this service will receive the same instance.\n",
    "1. Use Singleton for stateless services (e.g., logging, caching) that don’t need to change during the application’s lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoped: One instance per HTTP request:\n",
    "A scoped service is created once per HTTP request. During a request, all classes that depend on the scoped service will share the same instance. However, a new instance will be created for the next request.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behaviors:**\n",
    "1. If multiple services or controllers request `IOrderService` within the same HTTP request, they will receive the same instance.\n",
    "2. For the next HTTP request, a new instance will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How It Works at Runtime\n",
    "1. `Request 1: First HTTP Request`\n",
    "   1. When the user adds an item to the `cart (CartController.AddToCart())`:\n",
    "      1. A new instance of `OrderService` is created for this request `(say, Instance A)`.\n",
    "      2. ServiceId (e.g., 2a3d) is assigned to this instance.\n",
    "   2. When the user proceeds to `checkout (CheckoutController.PlaceOrder())`:\n",
    "      1. The `same OrderService` instance (Instance A) will be used for this HTTP request.\n",
    "2. `Request 2: Second HTTP Request`\n",
    "   1. In a new HTTP request, when the user adds another `item or checks out`:\n",
    "      1. A new instance of `OrderService (say, Instance B)` is created for this new request.\n",
    "      2. ServiceId (e.g., 5f8e) is assigned to this new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transient: A new instance every time the service is requested\n",
    "A transient service is created every time it is requested from the DI container. This means that every dependent class or service will receive a new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behaviors:**\n",
    "1. Each time `INotificationService` is requested (even within the same HTTP request), a new instance will be created.\n",
    "2. If two controllers or two services request the same transient service, they will each get a `separate instance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When do Use Transient?**\n",
    "1. Use transient services when stateless behavior is needed, and a new instance is required every time, such as lightweight services with no shared state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Transaction\n",
    "A transaction is a sequence of operations that are treated as a `single unit`. The operations inside a transaction must meet the `ACID` properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Atomicity:` All operations must succeed, or none of them should apply.\n",
    "2. `Consistency:` The database moves from one consistent state to another.\n",
    "3. `Isolation:` Concurrent transactions are isolated from each other.\n",
    "4. `Durability:` Changes are permanent after the transaction is committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one operation fails, all changes are rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 1: Using EF Core Transactions:\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "using var transaction = await _context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();\n",
    "try\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Add order to the database\n",
    "    _context.Orders.Add(order);\n",
    "    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Add payment to the database\n",
    "    _context.Payments.Add(payment);\n",
    "    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Commit the transaction\n",
    "    await transaction.CommitAsync();\n",
    "    return true;\n",

    "catch (Exception)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // Roll back the transaction on error\n",
    "    await transaction.RollbackAsync();\n",
    "    return false;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2: TransactionScope in .NET Core:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use TransactionScope from System.Transactions. This approach allows you to wrap operations across multiple DbContexts or external services in a single transaction.\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "using var scope = new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeAsyncFlowOption.Enabled);\n",
    "try\n",
    "{\n",
    "    _context1.Orders.Add(order);\n",
    "    await _context1.SaveChangesAsync();\n",
    "\n",
    "    _context2.Payments.Add(payment);\n",
    "    await _context2.SaveChangesAsync();\n",
    "\n",
    "    scope.Complete();  // Commit the transaction\n",
    "    return true;\n",
    "}\n",
    "catch (Exception)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // No explicit rollback needed; scope will auto-revert if not completed\n",
    "    return false;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 3: Unit of Work with Repository Pattern\n",
    "When following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) or Clean Architecture, you can implement the Unit of Work (UoW) pattern to group multiple repositories under a single transactional scope.\n",
    "```c#\n",
    "public async Task<int> CompleteAsync()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    return await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
