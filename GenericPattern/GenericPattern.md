## Generic Pattern:
The generic pattern in C# provides a way to define classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for the type that will be specified later. This allows for code that is type-safe and reusable, reducing duplication and increasing flexibility.

1. `public interface IPublisher<T, K, E> where E : Enum`:
2. 1. `public interface IPublisher<T, K, E> where E : Enum where K: class`: `k` is a constraint of `class` and `E` is constraint to `Enum`
3. `public interface IPublisher<TMessage, TUser, TKey>`: whiout any constraint


### Converience:
Contravariance refers to the ability to use a less specific (broader) type where a more specific one is expected.

1. `internal interface IGenericPublisher<TMessage, TUser, in TKey>`: Because of contravariance, you can assign it to a more derived type.
    ```c#
    public class Entity { }
    public class UserEntity : Entity { }
    IGenericPublisher<string, string, Entity> entityPublisher = null;
    IGenericPublisher<string, string, UserEntity> userPublisher = entityPublisher;
    // This works because Entity is a base class of UserEntity. Thanks to contravariance, the interface can safely accept the more general Entity.
    ```
2. `internal interface IGenericPublisher<TMessage, TUser, TKey>`: this will not work in above implementations.
